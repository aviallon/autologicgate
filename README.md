# ~~autologicgate~~ Crappy CPU

~~Python~~ project whose goal ~~is to generate logic gate assembly matching a truth table.~~ is to make my own 8-bit CPU, with my own instruction set, an assembler, etc., from absolute scratch.
See `description.pdf` to have more informations.

Logisim-Evolution is needed to open `CPU.circ`, which is my CPU simulation under, well, Logisim. Prefer the git version as it is much better.
